# Ampada Code Challenge
In this application, users can see login, register, and see their email.


## App Architecture
* It uses a simple MVVM pattern with initializer-based dependency injection.
* It uses a clean architecture to split data, domain, and view
* There are three screens in the app with simple UI (UIKit).
* I tried to develop simple and readable logic.

## Time effort
* The total time effort put in is roughly 10 hours
* Planning: for thinking about what I want to do and drawing some think on paper and writing a blueprint: ~30M
* Data Layer: create the model's view and parse local data: ~2H
* Domain Logic: implement Application logic and all dependencies: ~5H
* ViewModels And ViewController: create all page views logic: ~2H
* Check: for refactoring and fix some few bugs: ~1H
* I know this app has some bugs and it can be better and can has some feature, but I wanted spend just 10 hours.

## For Future
* If I wanted to spend more time, I'd do these:
* 1- write test for all logic and models.
* 2- write more documents and comments.
* 3- improve UI.
* 4- append more features.
